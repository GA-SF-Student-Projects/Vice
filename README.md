<b>Bugs/Concerns:</b><br>
There are multiple layouts avaialble differentiating between phone and tablets.  The phone will have only one column in the category list, where as the tablet will have 2 columns in the list for portrait and 3 columns in the list for landscape.  

There is a memory issue for the tablet sizes when transitioning to landscape mode from portrait. Below is a screen shot of the error log (click for larger view).

<ul>
<li>Progress bar was prioritized, but never implemented for slow network speeds.</li>
<li>Bookmarks tab needs a refresh on the list set. If the user enters a bookmarked article from the bookmarks tab, the list is not refreshed after a back button press.</li>
<li>Post Presentation deadline bug fix on duplicate bookmarks being added on notification preferences. As well as refactoring, and a bug in Notifications message updates</li>
<li>If a user enters an article, and then presses the back button before the glide library loads the image, the app will crash -- java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: You cannot start a load for a destroyed activity</li>
